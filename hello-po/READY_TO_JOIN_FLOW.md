## ðŸš€ Meeting Ready-to-Join Flow

### What Changed:
Instead of redirecting to the meeting details page (`/meetings/${id}`) after creating a meeting, the app now redirects directly to the **call page** (`/call/${id}`) where users can immediately join the meeting.

### Benefits:
âœ… **One-click meeting creation and join** - no extra navigation needed
âœ… **Smoother user experience** - from creation to joining in seconds
âœ… **No more "Error Loading Meeting" issues** - bypasses the meeting details page entirely
âœ… **Consistent with user expectations** - when you create a meeting, you probably want to join it

### How It Works:

1. **Create Meeting** â†’ Click "New Meeting" button
2. **Fill Form** â†’ Enter meeting name and select agent
3. **Auto-redirect** â†’ Automatically taken to call lobby
4. **Join Call** â†’ Click "Join Call" to start the meeting with agent

### Files Changed:
- `src/modules/meetings/ui/components/new-meeting-dialog.tsx` - Changed redirect from `/meetings/${id}` to `/call/${id}`

### Test It:
1. Go to https://illustrious-moonbeam-62b25d.netlify.app
2. Click "New Meeting"
3. Fill out the form
4. You'll be taken directly to the call lobby - ready to join!

The agent will automatically join when you start the call. ðŸ¤–âœ¨
