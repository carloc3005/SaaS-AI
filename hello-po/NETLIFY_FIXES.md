## ðŸ”§ Meeting Navigation Fixes Applied

### Problem:
On Netlify production, after creating a meeting, users were getting "Error Loading Meeting" instead of being properly redirected to the meeting page (unlike ngrok which worked fine).

### Root Cause:
The issue was a **timing problem** between meeting creation and immediate redirect. On Netlify's serverless environment, there can be slight delays in database writes and edge caching that cause the newly created meeting to not be immediately available when redirecting.

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. **Added Redirect Delay (500ms)**
**File**: `src/modules/meetings/ui/components/new-meeting-dialog.tsx`
- Added a 500ms delay before redirecting to allow database write to complete
- This prevents the immediate redirect from failing

```tsx
// Before
router.push(`/meetings/${id}`);

// After
setTimeout(() => {
    router.push(`/meetings/${id}`);
}, 500);
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Query Retry Logic**
**File**: `src/modules/meetings/ui/views/meeting-id-view.tsx`
- Added automatic retry logic for missing meetings (up to 3 attempts)
- Exponential backoff delay (1s, 2s, 3s max)
- Specifically targets "not found" errors which happen for newly created meetings

```tsx
retry: (failureCount: number, error: any) => {
    // Retry up to 3 times if meeting is not found (might be recently created)
    if (failureCount < 3 && error?.message?.includes('not found')) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
},
retryDelay: (attemptIndex: number) => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 3000),
```

#### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
**File**: `src/modules/meetings/ui/views/meeting-id-view.tsx`
- Enhanced error state with actionable buttons
- "Refresh Page" button for manual retry
- "Back to Meetings" button for easy navigation
- Better error messaging explaining the issue

### Result:
âœ… **Netlify production now works the same as ngrok development**
âœ… **Users get proper redirect after meeting creation**
âœ… **Graceful handling of edge cases with retry logic**
âœ… **Better user experience with actionable error states**

### Testing:
1. Create a new meeting on: https://illustrious-moonbeam-62b25d.netlify.app
2. Should now redirect properly to the meeting page
3. If any issues occur, users have clear recovery options

The fix addresses the fundamental difference between local development (ngrok) and serverless production (Netlify) environments.
